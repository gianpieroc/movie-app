This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Instructions

To run the project, simply execute this command:
`npm install && npm start`

Note that I did leave the .env in the repo in order to let you check the app.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm coverage`
